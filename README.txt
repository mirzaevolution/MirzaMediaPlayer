HELLO WORLD ?

This is just a sample application built with Windows Presentation Foundation (wpf).
There is no external library included in the project. I created this project just
for demonstration purpose in creating simple media player in C# WPF. 

You can modify this application based on your need as this is just open source 
software. Please contact me [at] twitter.com/mirzaevolution or 
email ghulamcyber@hotmail.com for further information.
